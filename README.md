# genetic_algos
[See demo](https://gosimplegenetic.herokuapp.com/) - Deployed with Heroku CLI
>An attempt to study variations within the larger class of evolutionary algorithms using golang. This may end up being a tool for using genetic algorithms in various applications, but for now this is just to learn new concepts :) Some things learned/still learning were/are:

- Hill Climbing technique
- Golang generics (kinda)
- Golang html template rendering
- Heroku deployment nuance 

 ## Features
- Input field for adding target combination to be solved
- Displays mutations, final result and total number of epochs

 ## Todo
- TBA (Could optimize selections for hill climbing implementation)

 ## License 
- MIT
